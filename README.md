Flora is a FLexible Open Rest API framework for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

## Features

- **Resources in resources (recursive):** fetch as much as possible in one request, without duplicating code
- **Lightweight (but powerful) field/sub-resource selection syntax**: fetch exactly what you need in one request
- **Filter resources even by sub-resource-attributes**: resolve inside database when possible, or return ID lists
- **Pluggable data sources**: currently implemented: MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Solr/Lucene
- **Combine multiple data sources**: even on per-row-basis - "API-side-JOIN"
- **Highly optimized database queries:** internal SQL parser to remove unselected fields and thus unreferenced LEFT JOINs
- **Locale:** parameterize JOINs i.e. with a localeId - no need for database views which can't be parameterized
- **Handle all your special cases as good as possible:** hooks and events for extending features

## Server features

- Node.js HTTP-Server and Cluster based implementation with self-monitoring process-management
- Extremely verbose server-status - *see everytime what the server is doing and what is hanging around in production*
- Straightforward logging/error handling - *i.e. forward all errors to your favorite "error-monitoring-tool"*
- Updates in production with zero downtime - *almost every part of code and config is replaceable without shutdown*
- Comfortable development-features - *usual "code-change - F5 - see result"-workflow*

## Design goals

- Generic implementation just for reading - *offer helper for writing*
- Easy abstraction of complex and distributed database structures
- Easy standard cases with minimal boilerplate code - *special cases possible - "everywhere"*
- Flexibility, stability, performance, simplicity, transparency

## Examples

### URL structure

#### Format

```
/path/to/resource/<id>
    ?action=<action>
    &select=xxx
    &filter=xxx
    &limit=10
    &page=1
    &width=100 (additional parameters)
    &height=100
```

#### Example URLs

- `GET /article/123` (retrieve article 123 as JSON)
- `GET /article/` (list of all articles)

### Resource implementation

```js
module.exports = (api) => ({
    actions: {
        retrieve: (request, response) => {
            return api.resourceProcessor.handle(request, response)
        },

        hello: () => {
            return Promise.resolve("Hello World");
            // return "Hello World"
            // Also, a Stream of Buffer can be returned
        },

        foo: {
            default: (request, response) => {
                // If "foo" was a function, only the default format was allowed.
                // This way you can define additional formats:
            },
            image: (request, response) => {
                // This is executed when /myresource/123.image?action=foo is called.
                // The behaviour of each format is not dictated by the framework.
                response.header('Content-Type', 'image/png');
                return â€¦ // Stream or Buffer
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### Abstract definition

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resource primaryKey="id" xmlns:flora="urn:flora:options">
    <flora:dataSource type="mysql" database="contents" table="user"/>
    <id type="int"/>
    <firstname/>
    <lastname/>
</resource>
```
